#### What I've learned?

By developing this app I have learned how to use supabase for the backend of the app which includes authentication and authorization, uploading photos to supabase buckets, creating schemas for managing users, bookings and hotel cabins but also the application settings. On the frontend side I have worked in this project with React Query for caching data that I downloaded from supabase, Recharts for creating sales and stays charts. Different React hooks (for storing data in the URL and read it, but also custom hooks for managing data with React Query), Compound Components, Modals and implementing Dark Mode using CSS variables.
